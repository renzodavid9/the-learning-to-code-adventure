Welcome!

Topics:
- Logic:
    Riddles to practice problem solving, abstraction, and modeling.
- Algorithmic thinking:
    - Concept.
    - Model real life algorithms, e.g, your daily routine.
        - We tend to abstract things.
        - We use our own language as human beings.
        - Make someone else reade the algorithm and check if makes sense.
    - Flowcharts.
- Computer algorithms:
    - How does a computer works?
        - Deterministics.
        - Discret.
        - It does exactly what you tell it to do.
    - Numeral systems.
    - Main pieces:
        - Variables.
            - Just a couple of basic data types.
        - Conditions.
        - Loops.
    - Paradigms:
        - Structured.
        - Object Oriented.
        - Functional.
- Let's code!:
    - Variables:
        - Hello world.
        - Print "Hello {user_name}"
        - Read number and print a math operation with it.
            - Understand what is casting.
        - Read name and profession and print a message with both things.
        - Change the value of two variables.
        - Change the value of two variables without using an intermediate variable.
    - Conditionals:
        - Read someone age and print if is adult or not.
            - Basic conditions.
        - Check what's the biggest between two number.
            - Basic conditions.
        - Check what's the biggest between three numbers.
            - More conditions to check everything.
        - Check a type of triangle:
            - What data of the triangle is needed?
        - Grades: translate 100...0 to A, B, C.
        - Check if number is odd or even.
        - Check if a given string (only one letter), is number or not.
        - Check if a year is a leap-year.
